# Pressbooks live coding exercise

Please complete the source code to make all the tests pass âœ…, you'll need a little knowledge of (OOP, dependency injection, polymorphism, access modifiers, callbacks, late static binding)

**TIPS**
> You can use file_get_contents to fetch internet data if needed, (no http client required)

> If you need to modify the composer.json you can do a `composer dumpautoload` to refresh the autoloader lo load new files or classes, `require` or `include` directives are not allowed

Have fun ðŸ¤“

`composer install`

`vendor/bin/phpunit tests --colors=auto`

Remember you can filter the tests file by file

`vendor/bin/phpunit tests --colors=auto --filter ComputerTest`
